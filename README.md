* **How Does Sonic the Hedgehog - Chaos Emeralds Collector Work?**
The game begins with a random target score between 19 and 120. The player is presented with four emeralds to choose from, each with their own random unknown point values ranging from 1 to 12. The goal is to determine these point values by clicking on them. When clicked on, their point value is added to the player's total score. The game is won when the player is able to match their total score to the target score. A loss occurs when the player's total score goes over the target score. Each time a player wins or loses, the result is kept track of in a log on the screen, an animation associated with the result is displayed, and the game is reset.
